			<h2><strong>The basics of a good interior design.</strong></h2>
			<img src="image/home1.jpg" alt="home1">
			<p>When Pablo Picasso was an old man, he was sitting in a café in Spain, doodling on a used napkin. He
				was nonchalant about the whole thing, drawing whatever amused him in that moment—kind of the
				same way teenage boys draw penises on bathroom stalls—except this was Picasso, so his bathroomstall
				penises were more like cubist/impressionist awesomeness laced on top of faint coffee stains.
				Anyway, some woman sitting near him was looking on in awe. After a few moments, Picasso
				finished his coffee and crumpled up the napkin to throw away as he left.
				The woman stopped him. “Wait,” she said. “Can I have that napkin you were just drawing on? I’ll
				pay you for it.”
				“Sure,” Picasso replied. “Twenty thousand dollars.”
				The woman’s head jolted back as if he had just flung a brick at her. “What? It took you like two
				minutes to draw that.” <br><br>
				“No, ma’am,” Picasso said. “It took me over sixty years to draw this.” He stuffed the napkin in his
				pocket and walked out of the café.
				Improvement at anything is based on thousands of tiny failures, and the magnitude of your success
				is based on how many times you’ve failed at something. If someone is better than you at something,
				then it’s likely because she has failed at it more than you have. If someone is worse than you, it’s
				likely because he hasn’t been through all of the painful learning experiences you have.
				If you think about a young child trying to learn to walk, that child will fall down and hurt itself
				hundreds of times. But at no point does that child ever stop and think, “Oh, I guess walking just isn’t
				for me. I’m not good at it.”
				Avoiding failure is something we learn at some later point in life. I’m sure a lot of it comes from
				our education system, which judges rigorously based on performance and punishes those who don’t
				do well. Another large share of it comes from overbearing or critical parents who don’t let their kids
				screw up on their own often enough, and instead punish them for trying anything new or not
				preordained. And then we have all the mass media that constantly expose us to stellar success after
				success, while not showing us the thousands of hours of dull practice and tedium that were required to
				achieve that success.
				At some point, most of us reach a place where we’re afraid to fail, where we instinctively avoid
				failure and stick only to what is placed in front of us or only what we’re already good <br><br><br>
